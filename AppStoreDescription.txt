Log blood glucose measurements and insulin doses.

Glucose is meant to be a convenient and simple tool for helping diabetics record blood glucose measurements and insulin usage. It's built on the principle of doing one thing and doing it well, and should have everything needed for day to day use. If you find that a frequently needed feature is missing, please let me know.

Thanks to everyone at Ars Technica's Mac forum who helped me test and refine Glucose.
